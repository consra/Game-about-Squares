# Game-about-Squares
The project is a implementation of a solver for the game ["Game about Squares"](http://gameaboutsquares.com/), using lazy search in the space of game states in order to solve every level of the game. The algorithm used for solving the game was done with iterative deepening depth-first search (a limited version of DFS).
